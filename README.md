# GNN Embedding Learning Visualization

**An educational demo visualizing how a Graph Neural Network (GraphSAGE) learns 2D node embeddings on a simple graph.**

---

## Project Overview

This notebook demonstrates unsupervised representation learning on graphs using a GraphSAGE model.

By constraining embeddings to two dimensions, the learning process becomes visually interpretable, allowing to watch how nodes gradually cluster according to the graph topology.

This demo is provided as a Jupyter notebook fully set up to run immediately on Google Colab â€” no local installation required.
