# GNN Embedding Learning Visualization

**An educational demo visualizing how a Graph Neural Network (GraphSAGE) learns 2D node embeddings on a simple graph.**

---

## Project Overview

This notebook demonstrates unsupervised representation learning on graphs using a GraphSAGE model.

By constraining embeddings to two dimensions, the learning process becomes visually interpretable, allowing to watch how nodes gradually cluster according to the graph topology.
